# Razorpay Webhook Edge Function Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ All TypeScript Errors Fixed!

The following issues have been resolved:
- ‚úÖ Import statements now use `@ts-expect-error` for Deno runtime modules
- ‚úÖ Deno global variables properly handled with `@ts-expect-error` 
- ‚úÖ Request parameter properly typed as `Request`
- ‚úÖ Error handling with proper type checking for `unknown` errors
- ‚úÖ All imports updated to compatible Deno std library versions

## üöÄ Manual Deployment Steps

Since we need your exact Supabase project reference, please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Get Your Project Reference
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/projects
2. Find your "Quantum Rishi" project
3. Copy the Project Reference ID (20-character string like `abcdefghijklmnopqrst`)

### Step 2: Link the Project
```bash
# In your project directory
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF_HERE
```

### Step 3: Deploy the Function
```bash
# Deploy the razorpay-webhook function
supabase functions deploy razorpay-webhook
```

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables
In your Supabase dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Edge Functions, add these variables:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_webhook_secret_here
```

### Step 5: Update Razorpay Webhook URL
In your Razorpay dashboard, set the webhook URL to:
```
https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/razorpay-webhook
```

## üõ† Alternative: One-Click Deployment Script

Run the Windows deployment script:
```cmd

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-razorpay-signature: test_signature" \
  -d '{"event": "payment.captured", "payload": {"payment": {"entity": {"id": "test"}}}}'
```
